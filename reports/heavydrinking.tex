\begin{abstract}
	It's the unfortunate reality that people drive under the influence of alcohol, leading to accidents, which may result in injuries and even fatalities.
	With modern technology such as smartphones becoming a norm in the current day and age, it is a responsible decision to exploit the power of technology to avoid human disasters and prevent fatalities.
	In our paper, we aim to do just that by following an approach that seeks to determine the alcohol consumption level using smartphone data and identify how our ensemble methods compare to the performance of the methods discussed in \textit{Learning to Detect Heavy Drinking Episodes Using Smartphone Accelerometer Data} \cite{DBLP:conf/ijcai/KillianPNMC19}.
	To achieve this, we used the available accelerometer data from the smartphone to create a regression model that predicts the transdermal alcohol concentration.
	For the preparation of the data set, we used various methods such as interpolation, and splitting the data into sets containing only valid data.
	To optimize our machine learning model, we extracted features with sliding windows. Our best regression model presented a result with 0.0058061 mean squared error but it did not match our expectations.
